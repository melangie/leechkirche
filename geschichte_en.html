            <div style="text-align:justify;">
              <p>The Leechkirche Mariä Himmelfahrt am Leech was built ‘outside Grätz on a hill called Leech’. The name of the hill is derived from the Middle High German ‘lê’ for hill or burial mound and thus refers to its role as a burial site in prehistoric and early historical times. According to older tradition, the Babenberg Duke Leopold VI first built a chapel in honour of Saint Cunegonde in 1202. This story goes back to the Styrian regional historian and Augustinian canon Aquilin Julius Caesar and cannot be verified elsewhere. According to more recent research, however, the construction was probably initiated by the Traungau margraves before 1192. It could therefore be related to the wife of Margrave Otakar III, Kunigund, who died in 1184, as can be reconstructed from a document from 1233. This document mentions that the church was built by the predecessors (‘antecessores’) of Frederick II. The earliest documentary mention dates back to 1224 and 1227, when Duke Leopold VI held court ‘iuxta capellam sancte Chunegundis’, i.e. next to the chapel of St Cunegonde.</p>
              <p>The previously mentioned document from 1233 in turn documents the donation of the chapel by the last Babenberg Duke Frederick II to the Teutonic Knights for defence reasons. This order had emerged in 1190 during the Third Crusade at the Siege of Acre from the group of Teutonic Knights, who had maintained a hospital in Jerusalem since 1128. In 1250, the Kunigunden Chapel was severely damaged or even destroyed. As the Hungarian King Bela IV paid compensation to the Knights of the Order in 1255, the damage could be linked to the battle for the Babenberg inheritance between Ottokar of Bohemia and Bela IV. The chapel was presumably repaired with this money or a new building was initiated, but this stagnated for financial reasons. The continuation or start of the new construction is attested by the indulgence of 25 July 1275. Further indulgences supported the continuation of construction, whereby the indulgence of 30 August 1293 can be seen as an indication of the completion of construction. At this time, the Virgin Mary was probably also appointed as the church's patron saint.</p>
              <p>In the first half of the 14th century, from 1335 to 1337 to be precise, there is evidence of a foundation of stained glass windows and thus the completion of the glazing. On 9 December 1500, both the stained glass windows and the church roof were destroyed by a storm. Various changes were subsequently made to the building during repairs. The windows on the north side were presumably walled up in the process. In 1662, the condition of the building was again so bad that demolition was considered. However, in the years that followed, the sacristy was rebuilt and the high altar renewed. But the worries about the building were by no means over, and in the 1980s there was another threat of demolition. This was again followed by extensive renovation work, such as the removal and rebuilding of the two towers and the renewal of the window reveals on the west and south fronts.</p>
              <p>The last restorations date back to the 20th century, when thorough renovations were carried out in 1952/3 and 1991-1994 respectively. In between, the church was handed over from the Teutonic Knights to the Graz-Seckau diocese in 1978 and named Graz University Church by Bishop Johann Weber in 1985.</p>
